-- How to run the program --

- Install Python 
	- Very important to have not install version 3.7, because it is not 
	  compatible with library tensorflow
	- Use instead 3.6 (Version 3.6.5 was used on this project) 

- Install necessary libraries
	- use pip install <library>

- Run file 'main.py'
	- Can use terminal to run this file (on Windows): 
		'python main.py'
